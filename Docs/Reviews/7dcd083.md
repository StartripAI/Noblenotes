# Self-Review for 7dcd083

## What changed
- Added a release checklist generator script that scans required modules/tests, documents required commands, and lists any [GATE0]..[GATE6] TODO markers.
- Generated `Docs/release_checklist.md` from the new script.

## What tests were added
- None.

## Risks remaining
- Checklist logic depends on fixed module/test naming conventions and simple string matching for command documentation; renames could cause false negatives.
- TODO marker scan is limited to a few file extensions and may miss tags in other file types.
